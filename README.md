  Lead Collector
</h1>

### Overview

This project is written in `React` and `Typescript` and will focus on lead collection. We will implement a simple form with input validation, and use existing backend service.

The form will allow users to enter data such as e-mail address, and then make use of that data to collect leads by saving them in our database.

**Is uses Gatsby to provide static files generation.**

### Functionality

â€¢ **Form validation**: Payload that is being sent must be validated on the front-end

â€¢ **Form submission**: Payload must be sent to our external API service

â€¢ **Theme switch**: User will be able to switch form theme, so it will be much more engaging to use
